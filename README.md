This repository contains the second project of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page">The Odin Project</a>, related to **HTML** and **CSS**.

Through this second project I have reviewed various previous knowledge of CSS and, above all, learned how to work using Flexbox. It's amazing how many things you can do.

I hope to continue enjoying this learning process. :v:
